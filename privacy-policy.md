The privacy of user data is a top priority for the Company. This policy identifies: what data is collected and why; how user data is handled; and a user's rights with respect to their data. The Company promises to not to sell user data.

This policy applies to all applications built and maintained by The Company namely Backdrop (all versions).

## What we collect and why

Our guiding principle is to collect only what is necessary and required to maintain a positive user experience.

### Identity & access

Account creation will require an email so that the user may have a unique and personalized experience in the application. In addition, the Company will use this information to send notifications, plan updates, and other essential information. Newsletters and other promotional information will only be sent to the user if consent is provided. 

### Billing information

A paid account is required to operate the application after a the free trial period has expired. Credit card and billing information that Backdrop uses could come from the Google Play Store, the Apple App Store or an additional payment processor if a credit card is not on file with the ladder applications. Credit card information is submitted directly to the payment processor and won't be stored in the application or it's servers. A record of the payment will be stored that includes the last 4 digits of the credit card number, for purposes of account history, invoicing, and billing support. A billing address is stored for the purposes of charging for service, calculation of sales tax due, sending invoices, and detecting fraudulent credit card transactions. Occasionally, aggregate billing information may be used to guide marketing efforts.

### Product interactions

Backdrop will store user generated images and uploaded content on its servers within an individual user account. This storage is necessary to provide the intended and expected user experience. This content will be stored for as long as the user account is active. If an account owner chooses to delete their account, the appropriated data will be deleted in accordance with our Terms of Service Policy.

### Geolocation data

The application will log the full IP address of the device used to create an account. This information will be retained to prevent fraudulent sign ins and additional security purposes. This data will be stored for as long as the account is marked active. 

### Advertising and Cookies

Backdrop runs contextual ads on various third-party platforms such as Google, Reddit, and LinkedIn. Users who click on one of our ads will be sent to the Backdrop website.

### Voluntary correspondence

If a user emails the Backdrop Customer Support email with a question or to ask for help, the correspondence will be retained, including the customer email address, so that a history of past correspondences may be reference for future inquiries.

If a user agrees to participate in a survey on application functionality or customer satisfaction that response may be retained for Backdrop analysis and usage. 


### Mobile app permissions

Backdrop is offered on both desktop and mobile platforms. To utilize certain functions on a user's mobile device the application will typically request the user's consent before accessing contacts, calendar, camera, and other privacy-sensitive features of the device. Consent is always optional and our apps will function without it, though some features may be unavailable.

## User Information Use Cases

**To provide products or services the user has requested upon the download and acceptance of the stated policies**.  Some third-party sub-processors are utilized to run the application and provide the functionality and user experience innate to the Backdrop Application. 

User information may also be utilized if the user decides to integrate a third party service such as a login with a Gmail account. 

No user account will be actively monitored unless consent is given in the event an in application error occurs or there is reasonable suspicion to believe the user is in violation of the content policy.

**To help troubleshoot or squash a software bug, with your permission.**  If at any point the Backdrop team need to access to a user's content to help with a support case, they will ask for your consent before proceeding.

**To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding restricted uses.**  Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. Backdrop aims to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us, and the Company will do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If it is discovered that a user is abusing the use of the application for a restricted purpose, action will be taken as necessary, including notifying appropriate authorities where warranted.

**When required under applicable law.**

Backdrop LLC is a U.S. company and all data infrastructure are located in the U.S.

-   Requests for user data. Our policy is to not respond to government requests for user data unless we are compelled by legal process or in limited circumstances in the event of an emergency request. However, if U.S. law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring us to share data, the Company must comply. Likewise, the Company will only respond to requests from government authorities outside the U.S. if compelled by the U.S. government through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement. It is the Company's policy to notify affected users before data is shared unless legally prohibited from doing so, and except in some emergency cases.
-   Preservation requests. Similarly, the Company's policy is to comply with requests to preserve data only if compelled by the U.S. Federal Stored Communications Act, 18 U.S.C. Section 2703(f), or by a properly served U.S. subpoena for civil matters. The Company does do not share preserved data unless required by law or compelled by a court order that the Company choose not to appeal. Furthermore, unless the Company receive a proper warrant, court order, or subpoena before the required preservation period expires, the Company will destroy any preserved copies of customer data at the end of the preservation period.
-   If the Company is audited by a tax authority, there may be a requirement to share billing-related information. If that happens, the Company will share only the minimum needed, such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.

Finally, if Backdrop LLC is acquired by or merges with another company user's will be notified before any personal information is transferred or becomes subject to a different privacy policy.

## Information Rights

The Company strives to apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Some of these rights include:

-   **Right to Non-Discrimination.**  The Company will not charge you a different amount to use the application, offer different discounts, or give a lower level of customer service because a user has exercised their data privacy rights.

## Location of site and data

The Company and Backdrop are operated in the United States. If a user is located in the European Union, UK, or elsewhere outside of the United States,  **please be aware that any information provided to us will be transferred to and stored in the United States**. By using the application and/or providing information pertinent to create an account, as an active user, you consent to this transfer.

## When transferring personal data from the EU

The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) has issued guidance that personal data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that is granted under EU privacy law. UK law provides similar safeguards for UK user data that is transferred out of the UK. Accordingly, the Company has adopted a data processing addendum with Standard Contractual Clauses to help ensure this protection. 

There are also a few ad hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the U.S. in connection with Backdrop LLC operations, for instance, if an EU user signs up for a newsletter or participates in a survey or buys merchandise from the Company. Such transfers are only occasional and data is transferred under the  [Article 49(1)(b) derogation](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-49-gdpr/)  under GDPR and the UK version of GDPR.

## Changes & questions

The Company may update this policy as needed to comply with relevant regulations and reflect any new practices. Whenever a significant change is made to our policies, the date will be recorded at the top of this page and appropriate steps will be taken to notify users.
